# ELVIS

# **Description**:

Currently developing a computer vision system that combines classical image processing techniques with machine learning algorithms, developed in Python. The project aims to optimize accuracy and efficiency in visual analysis through the integration of traditional methods and machine learning.

# **Challenges and Solutions**:

The project faces the challenge of running the vision system on embedded systems with limited resources. Optimization techniques are applied to reduce resource consumption without affecting performance. Additionally, it aims to lower the costs of conventional vision systems by using more efficient algorithms and hardware, ensuring accessibility.

# **Role and Responsibilities**:

Sole developer responsible for the complete design, implementation, optimization, and deployment of the ELVIS vision system.
